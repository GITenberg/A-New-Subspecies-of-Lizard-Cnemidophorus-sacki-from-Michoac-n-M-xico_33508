<p>The systematic status of the populations of lizards assignable to
<i>Cnemidophorus sacki</i> in western M&eacute;xico (Sonora southward to
Jalisco) has been reviewed in detail by Zweifel (1959, Bull. Amer.
Mus. Nat. Hist, 117 (2):57-116), who stated that the use of the
specific name <i>sacki</i> for the western populations rests upon a reasonable,
but as yet unproved, assumption that intergradation occurs.
Although Zweifel examined specimens of the nominal subspecies
from the upper Balsas Basin, he did not study specimens from the
intervening area&mdash;the Tepalcatepec Valley in Michoac&aacute;n.</p>

<p>Field studies and the examination of large series of preserved
specimens of <i>Cnemidophorus</i> from the <a name="Tepalcatepec"></a><a href="#Typo_Corr">Tepalcatepec</a> Valley show
the presence of <i>Cnemidophorus sacki</i> in the region between the
ranges of <i>C. sacki sacki</i> in the upper Balsas Basin and <i>C. sacki
occidentalis</i> in Jalisco and southern Nayarit. Furthermore, the
populations of <i>sacki</i> inhabiting the Tepalcatepec Valley have characters
of scutellation and coloration that distinguish them from
other described subspecies of <i>sacki</i>. In recognition of the important
contributions to the systematics of the genus <i>Cnemidophorus</i> made
by Dr. Richard G. Zweifel, I propose that the subspecies of <i>Cnemidophorus
sacki</i> in the Tepalcatepec Valley be named as follows:</p>

<div class="center"><b>Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli</b> new subspecies</div>

<div class="blkquote">
<p><i>Holotype.</i>&mdash;University of Michigan Museum of Zoology No. 119542, from
Capirio, Michoac&aacute;n, M&eacute;xico (185 meters), an adult male, one of a series
collected on June 13, 1958, by William E. Duellman, Jerome B. Tulecke, and
John Wellman. Original number WED 12310.</p>

<p><i>Paratopotypes.</i>&mdash;UMMZ Nos. 119536-119541 and 119543-119550.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;A race of <i>Cnemidophorus sacki</i> characterized by large size
(more than 130 mm. snout-vent length in males), approximately 106 dorsal
granules around the midbody, about 41 femoral pores, and a dorsal color-pattern
in adult males consisting of lateral and dorsolateral rows of spots,
paravertebral rows fused with middorsal light green area at least anteriorly,
and pink throat having a median light blue spot or transverse band.</p>

<p><i>Description of Holotype.</i>&mdash;Snout-vent length, 128 mm.; tail length, 252
mm.; tail/body ratio, 1.97; scutellation typical of <i>sacki</i>&mdash;four supraoculars,
enlarged postantebrachials, and enlarged mesoptychials; 107 granules around
midbody (excluding enlarged ventrals); 45 femoral pores; three enlarged
preanal scales; supraorbital semicircle-series extending anteriorly to posterior
edge of frontal (<a href="#Fig1">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span></p>
<div class="blkquote">
<p>Top of head and nape dusty brown; tip of rostral and lateral edges of
superciliaries dark cream-color; upper labials and sides of head anterior to
eyes cream-color, mottled with blue; lower labials and postocular region pale
blue; mental, postmental, and sublabials cream-color. Upper surfaces of
forelimbs dull bluish gray, spotted with pale greenish yellow; dorsal surfaces
of proximal one-fourth of tail light brownish gray turning to pale orange-brown
posteriorly; lateral surfaces of tail bluish gray anteriorly and creamy brown
posteriorly. Nuchal region light bluish gray; flanks dark gray; dorsal ground-color
dark brown, somewhat paler posteriorly. Body having a row of cream-colored
spots in place of a lateral stripe, and another row in place of dorsolateral
stripe; dorsally, large diffuse tan or light green spots partially fused and
tending to form irregular transverse markings. Chin to posterior end of sublabials
pale pink, bordered posteriorly by bluish white area, and then pink.
Mesoptychials, under surfaces of hind limbs, and belly cream-colored; anterior
edges of belly scales dark blue; lateral two rows of ventrals on posterior two-thirds
of body dark blue having light blue or cream-colored spots. Under
surfaces of forelimbs bluish cream; ventral surface of tail cream-colored.</p>

<p><i>Variation in Size and Scutellation.</i>&mdash;The largest male has a snout-vent
length of 132 mm., the largest female, 114 mm., and the smallest juvenile, 34
mm. The number of dorsal granules at the midbody varies from 91 to 117
(106.2 ± 0.43); the ratio of the number of granules between the paravertebral
stripes to the number of granules around the body (PV/GAB) varies from
0.064 to 0.157 (0.097 ±0.007); the number of femoral pores varies from
32 to 49 (41.1 ± 0.20). Usually there are only three enlarged preanals, but
18 specimens have a somewhat enlarged scale anterior to the normal complement
of three. In 15 specimens the supraorbital semicircle-series terminate
short of the posterior edge of the frontal; in the others the series reach the
frontal.</p>

<p><i>Variation in Coloration.</i>&mdash;The coloration of juveniles and subadults varies
little; large adults vary considerably especially in the amount of diffusion of
the light green middorsal area. In some individuals the vertebral pale area
does not include the paravertebral spots; in other individuals the pale area
includes not only the paravertebral rows, but, at least anteriorly, the dorsolateral
rows. In large males of about equal size (and collected at the same
time) there is considerable variation in the amount of blue on the belly. In
a few of the males the belly is white with only the anterior edge of each scale
blue; in some only the lateral rows of ventrals on the posterior two-thirds of
the body are blue; in others all of the posterior two-thirds of the belly is blue.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Ontogenetic Change in Color Pattern.</i>&mdash;The metamorphosis of
color pattern in <i>Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli</i> results in the dorsal
ground-color becoming paler with age, the replacement of the
stripes by spots, and finally in large males the suffusion of these
spots.</p>

<p>A single hatchling (UMMZ 114732) is available; this specimen
has a prominent umbilical scar and a snout-vent length of 34 mm.
The top of the head is olive brown; the dorsal surfaces of the limbs
are dark brown with cream mottling; the dorsal ground-color is
brownish black; this is paler on the lower flanks. The lateral and
dorsolateral stripes are cream-colored; the paravertebral stripes are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
white. There is a faint, diffuse vertebral stripe anteriorly (<a href="#Fig2">Fig. 2 A</a>).
The throat and undersides of the limbs and tail are cream-colored;
the belly is bluish white. In life the stripes were pale yellowish
green, and the tip of the tail was pink.</p>

<p>In larger individuals the dorsal <a name="ground-color"></a><a href="#Typo_Corr">ground-color</a> is dark brown; the
lower flanks are grayish tan. Light brown diffuse spots are present
in the lateral and dorsolateral dark fields. The tan vertebral stripe
is diffuse and nearly fills the paravertebral dark fields; the paravertebral
stripes are faint posteriorly; throughout their length they are
scalloped&mdash;the beginning of their fragmentation into spots (<a href="#Fig2">Fig.
2 B</a>).</p>

<p>In subadults (± 80 mm. snout-vent length) the paravertebral
stripes are fragmented into spots posteriorly. Also, the dorsolateral
stripes in some individuals are fragmented posteriorly. The dorsolateral
dark fields are somewhat paler than the lateral dark fields.
Cream-colored spots are present on the flanks. The mottling on
the thighs tends towards the formation of light spots (<a href="#Fig2">Fig. 2 C</a>).</p>

<p>In small adults (± 100 mm. snout-vent length) the paravertebral
stripes are entirely fragmented into spots. The lateral and dorsolateral
stripes are broken into spots posteriorly. The middorsal pale
area (formed by the suffusion of the vertebral stripe) and paravertebral
and dorsolateral rows of spots are pale green. The cream-colored
spots on the flanks are expanded to form vertical bars
(<a href="#Fig2">Fig. 2 D</a>).</p>

<p>Large adult males (± 120 mm. snout-vent length) have all of
the stripes fragmented into spots. The diffuse middorsal area is
expanded and encloses the paravertebral rows of spots. The pale
spots present in the dark fields in smaller individuals are either
absent or fused with spots resulting from the fragmentation of the
stripes (<a href="#Fig2">Fig. 2 E</a>).</p>

<p><i>Sexual dimorphism.</i>&mdash;Males attain a larger size (known maximum
snout-vent length of 132 mm., as compared with 114 mm. in females).
Males have larger but not more numerous, femoral pores,
blue bellies, and pink and blue throats, whereas females are unicolor
creamy white ventrally. The more nearly complete metamorphosis
of color pattern exhibited by adult males probably is
correlated with their large adult size. Large females retain complete
lateral and dorsolateral stripes. The jowls of breeding males
are swollen.</p>

<p><i>Geographic variation.</i>&mdash;No noticeable geographic variation in
this subspecies is evident in the series from the Tepalcatepec
Valley. However, lizards from eastern Michoac&aacute;n (Chinapa, 6
km. N of Tafetan, 6 km. S of Tzitzio, and 19 km. S of Tzitzio) differ
slightly from those from the Tepalcatepec Valley; the eastern
specimens have fewer dorsal granules and femoral pores, and a
higher ratio of dorsal granules between the paravertebral stripes
to the number of granules around the body (see Tables 1-3). No
large adult males are present in the eastern series; the subadults
and small adult males have color patterns like lizards of similar
size from the Tepalcatepec Valley. The largest male from the east
has a snout-vent length of 110 mm., rows of pale spots, and no trace
of brown and tan cross-bars. Specimens of <i>Cnemidophorus sacki
sacki</i> of equal size from Guerrero, Morelos, and Puebla in the upper
Balsas Basin have a tan dorsum with dark brown cross-bars. The
localities in eastern Michoac&aacute;n are intermediate geographically
between the Tepalcatepec Valley and the known range of the
nominal subspecies in the upper Balsas Basin. In characters of
scutellation specimens from the east are intermediate between <i>C.
sacki sacki</i> and <i>C. sacki zweifeli</i> in the Tepalcatepec Valley. However,
in coloration the lizards from the east are like those from the
Tepalcatepec Valley, but differ distinctly from the nominal subspecies.
Therefore, the eastern series is referred to the subspecies
<i>C. sacki zweifeli</i>.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;Four other species of <i>Cnemidophorus</i> occur in
the Tepalcatepec Valley with <i>Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli</i>. Of
these, <i>C. calidipes</i> has a maximum snout-vent length of 79 mm., 66
to 86 dorsal granules, and a light brown dorsum with pale blue
spots and vertical bars; <i>C. communis communis</i> has a maximum
snout-vent length of 135 mm., 105 to 144 dorsal granules, and a
greenish tan dorsum with yellow spots; <i>C. deppei infernalis</i> has a
maximum snout-vent length of 84 mm., 91 to 120 dorsal granules,
and a striped pattern throughout life; and <i>C. lineatissimus exoristus</i>
has a maximum snout-vent length of 98 mm., 108 to 135 dorsal
granules, and a middorsal yellow stripe and vertical bars on the
flanks. Both <i>calidipes</i> and <i>communis</i> are like <i>sacki</i> in possessing
four enlarged supraoculars and enlarged postantebrachials, whereas
<i>deppei</i> and <i>lineatissimus</i> have three enlarged supraoculars and
granular postantebrachials. Juveniles of <i>calidipes</i> and <i>sacki</i> are
alike in coloration but different in the extent of the supraorbital
semicircle-series. In <i>calidipes</i> the supraorbital semicircle-series usually
are complete, whereas in <i>sacki</i> the series never extended anterior
to the posterior edge of the frontal.</p>

<p>From the geographically adjacent populations of <i>sacki</i> (<i>sacki</i> and
<i>occidentalis</i>), <i>zweifeli</i> differs in coloration and scutellation (see
Tables I-III). <i>Cnemidophorus sacki sacki</i> has a dorsal pattern in
adult males of dark brown cross-bars on a tan ground-color. Both
<i>occidentalis</i> and <i>zweifeli</i> have variable, diffuse color patterns in
large adults, but <i>zweifeli</i> differs from <i>occidentalis</i> in having a blue
spot on the pink throat.</p>

<p><i>Ecology.</i>&mdash;In the arid Tepalcatepec Valley <i>Cnemidophorus sacki
zweifeli</i> lives at elevations of 160 to 1300 meters. In the lower parts
of the valley the lizards live primarily in open scrub forests, characterized
by deciduous trees offering only partial shade from the
sun, especially during the prolonged dry season. Common trees in
this scrub forest are <i>Acacia cymbispina</i>, <i>Cercidium plurifoliolatum</i>,
<i>Mimosa distachya</i>, and <i>Prosopis juliflora</i>.</p>

<p>During the dry season (November through May) adult males
apparently aestivate; several large series collected in the winter
include only subadults and females. This absence of males is
corroborated by personal observations in the Tepalcatepec Valley
in April and May. In the summer rainy season the lizards are active
in the morning and again in the late afternoon; only <i>Cnemidophorus
calidipes</i> is active during the heat of the midday. In some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span>
areas of the scrub forest <i>Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli</i> is found in
association with <i>Cnemidophorus communis communis</i>. Throughout
the scrub forest <i>C. sacki zweifeli</i> occurs with <i>C. deppei infernalis</i>.
In some of the more dense scrub forest, where <i>C. sacki zweifeli</i>
is not so abundant as in the more open forest, it has been taken
with <i>C. lineatissimus exoristus</i>. In the open <i>Acacia-Cercidium</i> associations
on the valley floor <i>C. sacki zweifeli</i> occurs with <i>C. calidipes</i>.</p>

<p>This subspecies is not restricted to the scrub forest. On the
lower slopes of the Cordillera Volcanica in Michoac&aacute;n <i>C. sacki
zweifeli</i> has been collected in open pine-oak forest near Zirimicuaro
and Ziracuaretiro.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;<i>Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli</i> inhabits the valley
of the R&iacute;o Tepalcatepec in Michoac&aacute;n and probably extreme southwestern
Jalisco, and the western part of the Balsas Basin in
Michoac&aacute;n. No specimens have been seen from extreme western
Guerrero, but <i>C. s. zweifeli</i> may occur there.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
